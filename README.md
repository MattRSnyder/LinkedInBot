## Getting Started
**Prerequisites & Installation**
- Windows 10 or higher works best
- Make sure you have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) installed (any version will work)

**Download the LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot**

DOWNLOAD Unzip the .zip file and start LinkedInEasyApplyBot.exe with a double click. You may not be able to see the .exe. Don't worry, usually it's the file with the icon.

## FAQ
**How does this bot work?**<br>
The backend relies mainly on [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) to perform the job application automation with [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) used to build the GUI.

**Is my LinkedIn account safe?**<br>
Your account login info will only be stored locally on your computer in the .ini file so it will auto-login the next time you run the bot. As a general rule of thumb, you should always double check any app's source code from an unknown developer before running a .exe file which you can view above.

LinkedIn has been known to ban accounts that use automation software for automatic messaging, but it is extremely rare to get banned for using automation to apply for jobs.

**How do I know it's working?**<br>
The app will show console output at the bottom while applying to jobs and it opens a Chrome browser to do the job application automation so you can see it applying in realtime.<br>

**What do I do if I get an error?**<br>
Rarely, the bot will stop applying and most of the time it's because the LinkedIn page wasn't loaded correctly. Other times it's because you entered in incorrect login credentials. Double check your credentials and try again in a few minutes.
